This documentation describes the classes and interfaces
for Junicon, a Java-based interpreter for the Unicon programming language.
Unicon is a unique object-oriented dynamic language 
that supports goal-directed evaluation of generator expressions.
Junicon is implemented using program transformation 
onto another scripting language, Groovy, that runs under Java.
The result is a transformational interpreter for goal-directed evaluation
that has seamless integration with Java.
Junicon can function either as an
interactive line-by-line interpreter, or as a tool that can
translate its input to Java for compilation.

<P>
The transformational interpreter works by first parsing the 
source language into a decorated XML abstract syntax tree.
A series of transforms then take the XML language representation
into its substrate equivalent.
The program is first normalized
into a familiar form more amenable to translation to Java, 
by flattening nested generators and
making iteration explicit.
The normalized Junicon program is then transformed
into a Java class with expressions translated into calls on the Junicon runtime.
Lastly, the XML tree is deconstructed back into
the target Java language, and then the result is piped into the
the Groovy scripting engine.
The interpreter can function in several modes, either as an
interactive line-by-line interpreter, or as a tool that can
transform its input directly to Java.

<P>
Support is also provided for correlating error messages
back into the original source language,
so as to enable debugging and tracing.

<P>
The Junicon Interpreter is composed of the:
<UL>
<LI> Interactive shell, 
<LI> Parser and grammars, including the preprocessor,
<LI> Transformer that runs XSLT scripts, as well as
     supporting Java classes used by the XSLT scripts,
<LI> Startup scripts, including a Groovy prelude and a Unicon startup script,
<LI> Runtime Java classes for Junicon operators, functions, and-keywords,
constructs, and the iterator calculus kernel.
