	Sample programs exercising many features of the Unicon language
	may be found <a href="../samples/junicon">here</a>.
	The programs can either be run interactively, or compiled to Java.

	<p>
	To run the samples interactively, 
	download a sample, for example QuickSort.icn, and type:
	<source>
		junicon -i QuickSort.icn
	</source>
	From within Junicon, then type:
	<source>
		QuickSort.main("100");
	</source>
	Alternatively, you can run the program as a batch script by typing:
	<source>
		junicon QuickSort.icn 100
	</source>
	The other sample programs similarly take one input argument
	for the sample size.
	</p>

	<p>
	To compile the programs to Java, please see the section on 
	<a href="../html/running.html">Running Junicon</a>.
