<HR>
<P>
Convert Groovy closures to Java lambda expressions, using
Function, VariadicFunction and Callable.
Also provides versions of IconVar and IconVarIterator
that are dependent on Groovy Closures.
For use by the transforms in generating code for interactive Groovy operation.
When generating pure Java code, the transforms will use the default iterators.
