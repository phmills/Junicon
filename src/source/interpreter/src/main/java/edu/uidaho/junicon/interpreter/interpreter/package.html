	<HR>
	<P>
	The Interpreter package provides support for
	transformational interpretation of a source programming language.
	<P>
	The interpreter is structured as a meta-interpreter, that is,
	an outer interpreter that identifies parse units and their
	specific target language, for example specified in a directive, and 
	then passes them to the appropriate sub-interpreter 
	to fully parse, normalize, filter, transform, and execute on
	a substrate such as Groovy.
	<P>
	All of the interpreters, both the outer command shell
	or meta-interpreter, and the
	sub-interpreters, follow the same design and implement the same 
	interfaces:
	to parse, normalize, filter, transform, and then execute 
	a line of input.
	A meta-interpreter has the added responsibility
	to identify parse units and their target language
	and dispatch the detected complete statements
	to the appropriate sub-interpreter.
	<P>
	This package contains the command shell
	used in the transformational interpreter,
	as well as the interfaces and default implementation for 
	sub-interpreters.
