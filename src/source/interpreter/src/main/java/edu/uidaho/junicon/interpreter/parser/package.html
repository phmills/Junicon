<P>
The Parser package defines an abstract parser 
used by the transformational interpreter,
and a generic end-of-statement detector.
This abstract parser is used to implement a chain of preprocessors
and parsers for the interactive interpreter.

<P>
Input statements are first piped through a preprocessor
which handles directives and syntax touchup, 
then through a metaparser for end-of-statement detection,
then into the parser which generates an
XML Abstract Syntax Tree (XML-AST).
The parsed statements are then transformed using XSLT
and run on the substrate interpreter.

<P>
Parsers for a specific language are built using dependency injection
in the Spring configuration file:
the outer metaparser layer is injected with a technology-specific layer, 
such as for grammars/javacc, 
which in turn is injected with a language-specific generated parser
such as for Junicon.
