<HR>
<P>
Contains the implementation of the Unicon control constructs.
The control constructs are equationally defined
using iterator compositions.
<P>
The following is a summary of the
transforms into the calculus kernel.
Control constructs are transformed to simple constructor calls, e.g.
<PRE>
	if e1 then e2 else e3 ==> IconIf(e1,e2,e3)	
</PRE>
that invoke IconIterator kernel methods for the iterator calculus.
<P>
The exact iterator calculus kernel methods called for each of the constructs
are defined by the following equations.
<PRE>
Primitives: exists(x), bound(x), bound(x).succeed()
Define: |x| = x.bound() ~= forall(x:1) // always fails but record if nonEmpty
Define: y.bound().succeed() = y;succeed:1      // succeeds once then fails
Equation: exists(x) = not(isEmpty(x.bound()))
Equation: bound(x) = exists(x);fail
====
x;y;z	   => reduce(x:1 | y:1) | z
		== (x.bound() | y.bound() | z)
			where x.bound() is equivalent to forall(x:1)
			Bounded sequence, distinct from plain sequence ie concat
{x;}	   => x;null	// done in normalization, with trailingEmpty
every x	   => reduce(x)	// always fails
		== x.reduce()
every x do y => reduce(x & |y|)
		== (x & y.bound()).reduce()
while x do y => reduce((x:1 -> (y;succeed:1))*)
		== ((x.bound() | y.bound().succeed().guard(x))*).reduce()
		== every((x.bound() | y.bound().succeed().guard(x)).repeat())
while x      => reduce((x:1 -> (null;succeed:1))*)
until x do y => while (not x) do y
		== ((x.exists().not() |
			y.bound().succeed().guard(x))*).reduce()
		== every((x.exists().not() | y.bound().succeed().guard(x))*)
until x    => while (not x)
repeat x   => reduce((x ; succeed:1)*)	OR: while (true) do x
		== ((x.bound().succeed())*).reduce()
		== every((x.bound().succeed()).repeat())
		// repeat uses break, continue (sets isLoop)
not x	   => not(exists(x))
		== x.exists().not()
if g then x else y => g -> x|y
		== g.bound() | (x | y).guard(g)
		== g() ; (x | y).guard(g)
switch s { case c:e } => {{e'.guard(s);e.guard(e')}; ... }
suspend e  => e.doSuspend()
suspend e do y => (x in e) & ((suspend !x); |y| )
		== (x in e) & ((lift(x).bound()).doSuspend() | y.bound())
		// only suspends if succeed, else fail
return e   => return exists(e)	// only returns if succeed, else fail
		== exists(e).doReturn()
break	   => null.doBreak()
		break expr; is transformed to:
		(loop break expr)* =>
		(loop)* | (switch (broken) { which break expr })
continue   => null.doContinue()
